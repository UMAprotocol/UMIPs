# Summary
The DVM should support the addition of BNTvBNT as supported price IDs. The use of these price identifiers will primarily be used for call options. This UMIP will also outline how to calculate the price of vBNT using a custom script that will be used for the call option price calculation.

This UMIP can also be extended to creating a price feed for vBNT and amend the markets and data sources once we can use Bancor pools as a data source

# Motivation
The DVM currently does not yet support the required price identifiers. vBNT (the Bancor Governance Token) is being proposed as a supported collateral type along with the BNT token in a separate proposal.

The primary focus of this UMIP is to arrive at an expiry price for the vBNT call options. Below, we will outline how to calculate the price of the options. It should be noted that the method to calculate the price is specifically a price a t a given time.

# Markets and Data sources

Contract Addresses for Bancor Pools:
vBNT/BNT [0x8d06AFd8E322d39Ebaba6DD98f17a0ae81C875b8](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8d06AFd8E322d39Ebaba6DD98f17a0ae81C875b8)
 
# Price Feed Implementation

To get the price of of both and vBNT/BNT, the following script can be used. The script has 2 dependencies along with requiring an archive node URL.

Install the dependencies by running ` npm install web3` and `npm install decimal.js`.  

Once you have done this place your archive node URL in the `NODE_ADDRESS` field and set the time stamp in the `DATE_AND_TIME`. 

```
const Web3 = require("web3");
const Decimal = require("decimal.js");

Decimal.set({precision: 100, rounding: Decimal.ROUND_DOWN});

const DECIMAL_PLACES = process.argv.length > 2 ? Number(process.argv[2]) : 2;

const NODE_ADDRESS = "YourArchiveNodeAddress";
//UNIX Timestamp
const TIMESTAMP = 1621846582;

# Technical Specifications

**BNTvBNT**
Price Identifier Name: BNTvBNT

Base Currency: BNT

Quote currency: vBNT

Scaling Decimals: 18 (1e18)

Rounding: Round to nearest 6 decimal places (seventh decimal place digit >= 5 rounds up and < 5 rounds down)

# Rationale

Our pool contracts maintain an SMA (slowly-moving average) price, which offers protections from flash loans.
The choice in using Bancor's own pools is due to them being the highest liquidity pools for both tokens. 

The script is designed to give a price at a given time instead of a constant price feed. This is due to call options only requiring a price at the time of settlement. This choice is due to the vBNT token not being widely traded.

# Implementation

1. For the price request timestamp, query for the USDBNT prices by following the guidelines of UMIP-6. The open price of the 60-second OHLC period that this price request timestamp falls in should be used.

At the time of expiry for the call options. The price of BNT and vBNT can be calculated as follows. 
1. Get the SMA price of USDC/BNT from the USDC/BNT pool and BNT/vBNT from the BNT/vBNT pool, which can be done via the script above. The script will output 2 prices USDC/BNT average rate and vBNT/BNT average rate. 
2. You can use the above rates to obtain the USDvBNT rate.


# Security Considerations

Adding this new identifier by itself poses little security risk to the DVM or priceless financial contract users. However, anyone deploying a new priceless token contract referencing this identifier should take care to parameterize the contract appropriately to the reference assetâ€™s volatility and liquidity characteristics to avoid the loss of funds for synthetic token holders. 

Added to this, there will be no need to run liquidation bots since this price feed will be used for the the call options. 

This UMIP should be updated when the ability to create a price feed from Bancor pools is available. Currently, the USDBNT price feed does not point to the most liquid markets, which as it stands, are the Bancor pools. Once these feeds are available, the UMIP can be updated.
