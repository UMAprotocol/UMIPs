This will increase the cost of initiating disputes for the DVM.

Additionally, this UPP will decrease the final fees for RenDOGE, and BASK to around $400, reducing the cost of initiating disputes for the DVM.

## Rationale

It is extremely expensive, in terms of gas, for the DVM voters to vote on a price request. The DVM also pays out a relatively large number of rewards on each vote. To ensure that price requests remain rare, they need to be more expensive to discourage any sort of purposeful triggering.

While this does make the capital requirements for liquidators and disputers higher, the increased size of the final fee lockup is unlikely to deter honest participants.

It is also necessary to ensure that the cost of dispute is not so high that is it off-putting to raise valid disputes, risking invalid liquidations being left unchallenged.
