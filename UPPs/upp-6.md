## Summary

This UPP will remove SGT from the collateral currency whitelist introduced in [UMIP-8](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/UMIPs/blob/master/UMIPs/umip-8.md). 

## Rationale

SGT was approved as a collateral currency in [UMIP-96](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/UMIPs/blob/master/UMIPs/umip-96.md), liquidity has since dropped massively which is a concern for $UMA token holders since collateral liquidity is an important factor in determining whether a collateral currency is approved or rejected. This makes SGT an unsuitable collateral currency.
