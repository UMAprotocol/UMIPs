## Summary

This UPP will adjust the final fees for WETH, renBTC, WBTC, PERL, DSD and OCEAN  to be around $400.

## Rationale

UMA final fees have traditionally been targeted to a dollar value of $400 - see the rationale behind this in [upp-2](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/UMIPs/blob/master/UPPs/upp-2.md). Naturally, the dollar denominated price of collateral types will change over time, and it is the responsibility of UMA tokenholders to adjust these to a more reasonable level.

This page will give you the current final fees of these collateral types.

## Specifics

- The WETH final fee will be decreased to 0.2 WETH.
- The renBTC final fee will be decreased to 0.0075 renBTC.
- The WBTC final fee will be decreased to 0.0075 WBTC
- The PERL final fee will be decreased to 2500 PERL.
- The DSD final fee will be increased to 2500 DSD.
- The OCEAN final fee will be decreased to 300 OCEAN.
