## Data Report
This is a data report on the effects of the initial UMA Emission Reduction which lowered staking rates from 26.3% APR to 22.6% APR and went into effect on March 11, 2025. For full context, please read the original UMA Emissions Reduction post in UMIP 184:
https://github.com/UMAprotocol/UMIPs/blob/master/UMIPs/umip-184.md

The first emission reduction had no discernable impact on the amount of UMA staked as evidenced by the Voting Power chart at Discourse link above.

The number of total voters (see chart at Discourse link above) initially spiked after the emission reduction and has been trending downward since. This recent downward trend is not seen in the voting power graph which suggests the voter decline is likely due to small voters leaving after the gas rebate change which required a minimum stake of 500 UMA to be eligible for gas rebates. This change took effect on February 1st, but the first rebate under the new requirements was not paid out until March 13th. So many small voters may not have been aware of the change until mid March.

A better measure of the effect of the UMA Emission Reduction is to look at the number of addresses voting with over 500 UMA (see chart at Discourse link above). This removes the effect of the gas rebate minimum and only takes into account addresses that have enough stake to meaningfully contribute to UMA’s staking decentralization. Below is a chart of voters with over 500 UMA staked:

Based on the above data we recommend continuing with the UMA emission plans as laid out in the original proposal.

## Voting
A yes vote means that you would like to decrease the emissions rate from 0.155 UMA/s to 0.130 UMA/s. This would lower the staking rewards APR from the current 20% to an estimated 16.8%.

A no vote means that you would like to keep the emissions rate at 0.155 UMA/s
