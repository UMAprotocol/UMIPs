# SUMMARY

The DVM should support price requests for the below price indices:

- BAND/USD
- USD/BAND
- SDT/USD
- USD/SDT
- KP3R/USD
- USD/KP3R
- CREAM/USD
- USD/CREAM
- CHAIN/USD
- USD/CHAIN
- ERN/USD
- USD/ERN

The canonical identifiers should be `BANDUSD`, `USDBAND`, `SDTUSD`, `USDSDT`, `KP3RUSD`, `USDKP3R`, `CREAMUSD`, `USDCREAM`, `CHAINUSD`, `USDCHAIN`, `ERNUSD` and `USDERN`.

# MOTIVATION

These price identifiers would allow the above currencies to be used for the creation of synths using currencies. These tokens were proposed to be used as collateral in UMIP #96. Examples of synths that could be created using these currencies would be yield dollars or covered call options.

Proactively approving these price identifiers will make it easier for development teams and protocol treasuries to create new products using these ERC20 tokens and their price identifiers.

# RATIONALE

All of these base currencies have deep liquidity on Uniswap, SushiSwap, or both, and some have good liquidity on centralized exchanges, as well. The specifications for each price identifier are based on how we can find the most accurate price for the base currency. So, if a token has deep liquidity and high volume on Uniswap but little or no CEX activity, we would use a Uniswap TWAP. If a token has deep liquidity and high volume on two CEXs and Uniswap, we would take the median of the three prices (with a TWAP for Uniswap).

# BAND

## MARKETS & DATA SOURCES

Markets: Binance, Sushiswap, and Coinbase-Pro

* Binance: [BAND/USDT](https://api.cryptowat.ch/markets/binance/bandusdt/price)
* Coinbase Pro: [BAND/USD](https://api.cryptowat.ch/markets/coinbase-pro/bandusd/price)
* Sushi: [BAND/WETH](https://analytics.sushi.com/pairs/0xa75f7c2f025f470355515482bde9efa8153536a8)

How often is the provided price updated?
  - For Cryptowatch, the lower bound on the price update frequency is a minute.
  - For Sushiswap, the price is updated with every Ethereum block (~15 seconds per block)

Provide recommended endpoints to query for historical prices from each market listed.

* Binance: https://api.cryptowat.ch/markets/binance/bandusdt/ohlc?after=1617848822&before=1617848822&periods=60
* Coinbase-Pro: https://api.cryptowat.ch/markets/coinbase-pro/bandusd/ohlc?after=1617848822&before=1617848822&periods=60
* Sushiswap: https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/jiro-ono/sushiswap-v1-exchange

Sushi Query:
```
{
 pair(
  id:"0xa75f7c2f025f470355515482bde9efa8153536a8",
  block: {
    number:12519741
  }

  }
  token1 {
    id
    symbol
    name
    derivedETH
  }
  token0Price
  token1Price
}
}

```


Do these sources allow for querying up to 74 hours of historical data?
  - Yes.

How often is the provided price updated?
  - The lower bound on the price update frequency is a minute.

Is an API key required to query these sources?
  - No.

Is there a cost associated with usage?
  - For Cryptowatch, yes.
  - For Sushiswap subgraph, no.

If there is a free tier available, how many queries does it allow for?
  - The free tier is limited to 10 API credits per 24-hours; the cost of querying the market price of a given exchange is 0.005 API credits (i.e. querying both exchanges will cost 0.010 API credits).
  - Therefore, querying both exchanges can be performed 1000 times per day.
  - In other words, both exchanges can be queried at most every 86 seconds.

What would be the cost of sending 15,000 queries?
  - Approximately $5

## PRICE FEED IMPLEMENTATION

These price identifiers use the [CryptoWatchPriceFeed](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/protocol/blob/master/packages/financial-templates-lib/src/price-feed/CryptoWatchPriceFeed.js) and the [UniswapPriceFeed](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/protocol/blob/master/packages/financial-templates-lib/src/price-feed/UniswapPriceFeed.js).

## TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

### BAND/USD

**Price Identifier Name:** BANDUSD

**Base Currency:** BAND

**Quote currency:** USD

**Intended Collateral Currency:** USDC

**Scaling Decimals:** 18 (1e18)

**Rounding:** Round to nearest 6 decimal places (seventh decimal place digit >= 5 rounds up and < 5 rounds down)

**Does the value of this collateral currency match the standalone value of the listed quote currency?:** Yes.

**Is your collateral currency already approved to be used by UMA financial contracts?:** Yes.

### USD/BAND

**Price Identifier Name:** USDBAND

**Base Currency:** USD

**Quote currency:** BAND

**Intended Collateral Currency:** BAND

**Scaling Decimals:** 18 (1e18)

**Rounding:** Round to nearest 6 decimal places (seventh decimal place digit >= 5 rounds up and < 5 rounds down)

**Does the value of this collateral currency match the standalone value of the listed quote currency?:** Yes.

**Is your collateral currency already approved to be used by UMA financial contracts?:** In progress.

## IMPLEMENTATION

Voters should query for the price of BAND/USD at the price request timestamp on Coinbase Pro and Binance. Recommended endpoints are provided in the markets and data sources section.

```
1. For the cryptowatch endpoints, voters should use the open price of the 1 minute OHLC period that the timestamp falls in for both Binance and Coinbase Pro
2. Query the BAND/ETH price from SushiSwap using 15-minute TWAP.
3. Query the ETH/USD price as per UMIP-6.
4. Multiply the BAND/ETH price by the ETH/USD price and round to 6 decimals to get the BAND/USD price.
5. The median of Steps 1 and 4 should be taken.
6. The result from step 5 should be rounded to six decimals to determine the BANDUSD price.
7. (for USD/BAND) Take the inverse of the result of step 5, before rounding, (1/ BAND/USD) to get the USD/BAND price, and round to 6 decimals.
```

For both implementations, voters should determine whether the returned price differs from broad market consensus. This is meant to provide flexibility in any unforeseen circumstances as voters are responsible for defining broad market consensus.

## SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

$UMA holders should evaluate the ongoing cost and benefit of supporting this asset as collateral and also contemplate removing support of this collateral if liquidity concerns are identified. UMA holders should take note of the collaterals changes, or if added to robustness(Eg. via TWAPs) are necessary to prevent market manipulation.

An additional consideration is that on-chain liquidity for BAND is not particularly strong, with only $250,000 in liquidity in a Uniswap v2 pool and a nearly empty Uniswap v3 pool. If large amounts of BAND are used as collateral in liquidatable contracts, more on-chain liquidity would be desirable to make it easier to liquidate undercollateralized positions. This is a moot point if BAND is used for non-liquidatable contracts.

BAND has a circulating supply of 20.494 Million BAND coins and a max supply of 100 Million. Binance is the current most active market trading it.

2. Take the median of the price from the 2 sources.
3. Query the ETH/USD Price as per UMIP-6.
4. Multiply the SDT/ETH price by the ETH/USD price and round to 6 decimals to get the SDT/USD price.
5. (for USD/SDT) Take the inverse of the result of step 4 (1/ SDT/USD), before rounding, to get the USD/SDT price. Then, round to 6 decimals.
```

As always, voters should ensure that their results do not differ from broad market consensus. This is meant to be vague as the tokenholders are responsible for defining broad market consensus.

## SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

$UMA-holders should evaluate the ongoing cost and benefit of supporting this asset as collateral and also contemplate removing support of this collateral if liquidity concerns are identified. $UMA-holders should take note of the collateral’s nature as liquidity of the collateral changes, or if added robustness (eg via TWAPs) are necessary to prevent market manipulation.

SDT has a circulating supply of 9.9 Million SDT coins and a max supply of 45.6 Million. Uniswap (v2) is most active trading market.

4. Multiply the KP3R/ETH price by the ETH/USD price and round to 6 decimals to get the KP3R/USD price.
5. The median of the numbers from steps 1 and 4 should be taken
6. (for USD/KP3R) Take the inverse of the result of step 5 (1/ KP3R/USD), before rounding, to get the USD/KP3R price, and round to 6 decimals.

For both implementations, voters should determine whether the returned price differs from broad market consensus. This is meant to provide flexibility in any unforeseen circumstances as voters are responsible for defining broad market consensus.

## SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

$UMA-holders should evaluate the ongoing cost and benefit of supporting this asset as collateral and also contemplate removing support of this collateral if liquidity concerns are identified. $UMA-holders should take note of the collateral’s nature as liquidity of the collateral changes, or if added robustness (eg via TWAPs) are necessary to prevent market manipulation.

KP3R has a circulating supply of 231,573 KP3R coins and a max supply of 231,573. Sushiswap is the most active trading market.

## IMPLEMENTATION

Voters should query for the price of CREAM/USD at the price request timestamp on FTX and Binance. Recommended endpoints are provided in the markets and data sources section.

1. When using Cryptowatch, voters should use the open price of the 1 minute OHLC period that the timestamp falls in.
2. Voters should query the CREAM/ETH Price from Sushiswap (using subgraph) using 15-minute TWAP
3. Voters should then query the ETH/USD price as per UMIP-6
4. Multiply the CREAM/ETH price by the ETH/USD price and round to 6 decimals to get the CREAM/USD price.
5. The median of the numbers from steps 1 and 4 should be taken
6. (for USD/CREAM) Take the inverse of the result of step 5 (1/ CREAM/USD), before rounding, to get the USD/CREAM price, and round to 6 decimals.


For both implementations, voters should determine whether the returned price differs from broad market consensus. This is meant to provide flexibility in any unforeseen circumstances as voters are responsible for defining broad market consensus.

## SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

Cream has been audited by Trail of Bits as of 28 Jan 2021. A link to the audit report can be found here.

$UMA-holders should evaluate the ongoing cost and benefit of supporting this asset as collateral and also contemplate removing support of this collateral if liquidity concerns are identified. $UMA-holders should take note of the collateral’s nature as liquidity of the collateral changes, or if added robustness (eg via TWAPs) are necessary to prevent market manipulation.

CREAM has a circulating supply of 721,640 CREAM coins and a max supply of 9,000,000. Gate.io is the current most active market trading it and it has over $1 million in liquidity on Sushiswap.

## IMPLEMENTATION

```
1. Query CHAIN/ETH Price from Uniswap using 15-minute TWAP.
2. Query the ETH/USD Price as per UMIP-6 from for the timestamp requested.
3. Multiply the result from step 1 by the ETH/USD price from step 2 and round to 6 decimals to get the CHAIN/USD price.
4. (for USD/CHAIN) Take the inverse of the result of step 3 (1/ CHAIN/USD), before rounding, to get the USD/CHAIN price. Then, round to 6 decimals.
```

It should be noted that this identifier is potentially prone to attempted manipulation because of its reliance on one pricing source. As always, voters should ensure that their results do not differ from broad market consensus. This is meant to be vague as the tokenholders are responsible for defining broad market consensus.

## SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

Chain Games smart contracts were audited by HackenProof before deploying on main net, but the audit does not appear to be publicly available. The Chain Games operates on a Non-Custodial model, reducing exposure to users. The whitepaper can be found here for additional details. As mentioned above, CHAIN has a deflationary measure built in, which should serve to stabilize the value of this token in the future.

Relative to most fiat currencies, CHAIN is much more volatile and is very nascent in the Ethereum ecosystem. Contract developers should exercise caution when parameterizing EMP contracts using CHAIN as a collateral currency.

$UMA-holders should evaluate the ongoing cost and benefit of supporting this asset as collateral and also contemplate removing support of this collateral if liquidity concerns are identified. $UMA-holders should take note of the collateral’s nature as liquidity of the collateral changes, or if added robustness (eg via TWAPs) are necessary to prevent market manipulation.

CHAIN has a circulating supply of 293,097,683.00 CHAIN coins and a max supply of 500 Million. Its top market is Uniswap v2.

As always, voters should ensure that their results do not differ from broad market consensus. This is meant to be vague as the tokenholders are responsible for defining broad market consensus.

## SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

Ethernity Chain smart contract has been audited by Immune Bytes, which you can view Here. One low severity-risk regarding the ERN token was identified and addressed in the final version of the whitepaper.

Relative to most fiat currencies, ERN is much more volatile and is very nascent in the Ethereum ecosystem. Contract developers should exercise caution when parameterizing EMP contracts using ERN as a collateral currency.

$UMA-holders should evaluate the ongoing cost and benefit of supporting this asset as collateral and also contemplate removing support of this collateral if liquidity concerns are identified. $UMA-holders should take note of the collateral’s nature as liquidity of the collateral changes, or if added robustness (eg via TWAPs) are necessary to prevent market manipulation.

ERN has a circulating supply of 9,684,684 ERN coins and a max supply of 30 Million. Its top markets are Uniswap v2 and Uniswap v3.
