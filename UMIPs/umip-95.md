## Summary
The DVM should support price requests for the EUR/UMA, GBP/UMA, CHF/UMA, CAD/UMA, JPY/UMA, ZAR/UMA, KRW/UMA, NGN/UMA and PHP/UMA price indexes.

## Motivation
The DVM currently does not support these Forex price index to allow minting synthetic EUR, GBP, CHF, CAD, JPY, ZAR, KRW, NGN and PHP with a $UMA collateral. This would allow us to scale our synthetic asset offering and the use of $UMA as collateral for more sytnhetic fiat.

### Data Specification
To construct these price feeds we need to combine the price of UMA agaisnt USD with the price of USD against one of these currencies.

UMA/USD: Cryptowatch provides a free tier API for the price of UMA agaisnt USD (665 queries per day; the price update frequency is 60 seconds), and allows to query prices from various sources (Coinbase, Binance, Okex, Uniswap). To construct the UMA/USD price feed, we will calculate the median price between the three data sources used in the UMIP 57: Coinbase (USD), Okex (USDT) and Binance (USDT).

USD/XXX: TraderMade's APIs provides a free tier API to the price of USD agasint any currency (1,000 queries per month; the price update frequency is below 1 second for the live price, and 60 seconds for the historical price; it also provides subscription model for 30 pounds per month). Forex pair price should then be rounded to 5 decimals.

#### Specification on historical prices:
- Cryptowatch and TraderMade use a different input format for querying historical data: you need to use Unix timestamp for Cryptowatch, and YYYY-MM-DD-HH:MM for TraderMade.
- Price requests should use the minute price that is nearest and earliest than the price request timestamp. Voters should use the open price of the OHLC period prior or undergoing based on the price request timestamp. Cryptowatch and TraderMade endpoints are queried based on the OHLC period's open time. For example, a request for a Forex pair price at 2021-05-10-21:10:16 should use query for the same period and use the open price as a reference.

#### Weekend timestamp
Over the weekend or some official holidays the REST API for Forex pair prices does not return any price, but we can request the price of a certain moment before the market close (as ex: the closing price of Friday).

Due to unavailability of price feed for foreign exchange rates over the weekend or during some official holidays, tokenholders and users will be using the latest known price, which for the weekend is essentially the closing price of Friday. Same goes in a case of a liquidation process - the liquidator should use the last known price (during the weekend this is the closing price of Friday) in order to match with the price on which a synthetic asset was created, if it was created over the weekend. If not the closing price on Friday for a certain asset should be a navigating point in calculating the collateralization ratio of a position and in the liquidation process.

If a request timestamp takes place on a weekend or any other day the Forex market is closed, voters should use the latest tick as the price. For the weekend that would be the closing price of the asset on Friday and for official holidays this would be the last know price provided by the price feed.

## Rationale
Apart from the weekend, there is little to no difference in prices on liquid major Forex pairs like JPYUSD. 

TraderMade’s price feed is an aggregated feed from multiple Tier One and Two Banks, Market-Makers and Data Providers. They are popular with Quantitative Traders, Fintech companies and Institutional customers who require a high quality and trusted feed. Although other price feeds can be used for forex pairs, we'd reccommend using TraderMade price feed.

For collateral tokens price feed we'd reccommend using CryptoWatch, as it is the most widely used price feed currently on the market. CryptoWatch allows polling for price feeds from various exchanges, which allows getting a price feed even in the case where a certain exchange is in maintance or down due to technical reasons. Also the availability of multiple price feeds from various exchanges gives the opportunity to get a computed median price of a certain collateral token by comparing prices from various exchanges which mitigates the risk of a corrupted price feed.

## Implementation
To construct UMA/XXX or XXX/UMA price feed, we need to combine two price feeds: 
•	To get UMA/XXX: we divide UMA/USD by XXX/USD, or multiply it by USD/XXX.
•	To get XXX/UMA: we divide 1 by UMA/XXX.

Note that the FX rate price feeds have already been implemented in UMIPs [29](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/UMIPs/blob/master/UMIPs/umip-29.md) and [90](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/UMIPs/blob/master/UMIPs/umip-90.md). The UMAUSD price identifier has already been implemented in [UMIP-57](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/UMIPs/blob/master/UMIPs/umip-57.md#price-feed-implementation-3). This UMIP simply combines price identifiers from those three UMIPS to arrive at the XX/UMA price identifiers.

### Example: EURUMA and UMAEUR
- To construct the price for UMA/EUR we will multiply UMA/USD by USD/EUR.
- To construct the price of EUR/UMA we will divide 1 by UMA/EUR. 

#### Steps to construct the live prices:

As a reference you can look at [UMIP-57](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/UMIPs/blob/master/UMIPs/umip-57.md) as the below described approach has the same implementation.

Step 1: query prices for UMAUSD:
•	Coinbase Pro UMA/USD: https://api.cryptowat.ch/markets/coinbase-pro/UMAUSD/price
•	Binance UMA/USDT: https://api.cryptowat.ch/markets/binance/UMAUSDT/price
•	OKEx UMA/USDT: https://api.cryptowat.ch/markets/okex/UMAUSDt/price

Step 2: calculate the median price between the 3 prices

Step 3: query prices for USD/EUR
•	USD/EUR: https://marketdata.tradermade.com/api/v1/live?currency=USDEUR&api_key=api_key

Step 4: multiply the median price of UMAUSD by USD/EUR to get UMA/EUR or divide 1 by UMA/EUR to get EUR/UMA.

Step 5: Round the price based on the rounding defined in `Technical specifications` section.

#### Steps to construct historical prices:
Step 1: query historical prices for UMAUSD for the 10th of May 2021 at 6:03pm: 
•	Coinbase Pro UMA/USD: https://api.cryptowat.ch/markets/coinbase-pro/UMAUSD/ohlc?after=1620669780&before=1620669780&periods=60
•	Binance UMA/USDT: https://api.cryptowat.ch/markets/binance/UMAUSDt/ohlc?after=1620669780&before=1620669780&periods=60
•	OKEx UMA/USDT: https://api.cryptowat.ch/markets/okex/UMAUSDt/ohlc?after=1620669780&before=1620669780&periods=60

Step 2: calculate the median price between these 3 prices.

Step 3: query historical prices for USDEUR for the 10th of May 2021 at 6:03pm: 
•	USD/JPY: https://marketdata.tradermade.com/api/v1/minute_historical?currency=USDEUR&date_time=2021-05-10-18:03&api_key=apikey

Step 4: multiply the median price of UMAUSD by USD/EUR to get UMA/EUR or divide 1 by UMA/EUR to get EUR/UMA.

Step 5: Round the price based on the rounding defined in `Technical specifications` section.


To build UMAGBP prices, you just need to repeat these steps by changing USD/EUR by USD/GBP, etc.


### Price feed - liquidations and disputes

Liquidation and dispute bots should have their own subscription to price feeds. Our price-feed provider’s API documentation can be found [here](https://marketdata.tradermade.com/documentation). A reference TraderMade implementation that is used by liquidator and dispute bots can be seen [here](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/protocol/blob/master/packages/financial-templates-lib/src/price-feed/TraderMadePriceFeed.js).

For the self minting derivative version of dispute and liquidator bots we are using both TraderMade to get the price for any synth token against USD (as ex. EUR/USD) and the config file presented by UMA for constructing a jSynth/collateralToken price feed.

[UMA config file](https://gitlab.com/jarvis-network/apps/exchange/UMAprotocol/-/blob/jarvis-dev/liquidator-and-dispute-bots/packages/financial-templates-lib/src/price-feed/DefaultPriceFeedConfigs.js#L5).
[Jarvis config file already merged in the one above](https://gitlab.com/jarvis-network/apps/exchange/UMAprotocol/-/blob/jarvis-dev/liquidator-and-dispute-bots/packages/financial-templates-lib/src/price-feed/JarvisPriceFeed.js).

Our team has adjusted the original Liquidation and Dispute bots in order to fit the interfaces of our protocol. You can find our versions of the Liquidator and Dispute bots on the following GitLab links:

- [Liquidator Bot](https://gitlab.com/jarvis-network/apps/exchange/UMAprotocol/-/tree/jarvis-dev/liquidator-and-dispute-bots/packages/liquidator/src)
- [Dispute Bot](https://gitlab.com/jarvis-network/apps/exchange/UMAprotocol/-/tree/jarvis-dev/liquidator-and-dispute-bots/packages/disputer/src)

TraderMade is provided as an accessible source to query for this data, but ultimately how one queries for these rates should be varied and determined by the voter to ensure that there is no central point of failure.

In the case of a TraderMade outage voters can turn to any other available price feed API or a broker API, as the price feeds for the forementioned financial assets does not differ much between different providers. There might be some slight differences, however they are quite insignificant and would not affect the liquidation or dispute processes. For this case, we provide options for additional price feed providers that voters could utilize.

Additional information can be found through this [Merge request](https://gitlab.com/jarvis-network/apps/exchange/UMAprotocol/-/merge_requests/9/diffs#684c32f0fb1f86910a940cd6a4384ac1020404a7).

## Additional price feed providers

### Coingecko.com

Documentation for the API can be found [here](https://www.coingecko.com/api/documentations/v3).

- Live price feed data
- Historical prices based on date and time
- Registration is free and provides 100 free requests per minute

Example requests:

- Live Rate for UMAUSD: https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/simple/price?ids=UMA&vs_currencies=USD
- 

Note: you can query EUR/UMA, GBP/UMA, CHF/UMA, CAD/UMA, JPY/UMA, ZAR/UMA, KRW/UMA, NGN/UMA and PHP/UMA prices  (https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/simple/price?ids=UMA&vs_currencies=EUR) for live price, but not for historical price.

Coingecko computes prices using a volume-weighted approach.

Historical prices can be query for any currency as well, but it only returns one update per day,therefore, using Coingecko for historical price would not be possible until they increase it.

We do not reccommend using Coingecko price feed during voting disputes due to the lack of more granual historical data.

## Security considerations
Adding this new identifier by itself poses a little security risk to the DVM or priceless financial contract users. However, anyone deploying a new priceless token contract referencing this identifier should take care to parameterize the contract appropriately to avoid the loss of funds for synthetic token holders. Additionally, the contract deployer should ensure that there is a network of liquidators and disputers ready to perform the services necessary to keep the contract solvent.

While the price of JPY/USD or any other forex pair does not vary much across various price feed during the weekday, it may be more challenging to get a unified price feed on the weekend: first, while the underlying market is not closed, most of the broker and banks feeding the APIs price feed are; then, for the one providing a price feed, they often add a very big spread, which makes the price of forex pairs vary significantly by source; a way to mitigate it is to use the last price known. 

A consequence to this is the existence of gaps between the last quote on Friday to the first one on Sunday; while such gaps rarely exceed +/-2%, which should not put in danger the collateralization ratio, an exceptional event happening the weekend may create a bigger gap and could, in theory, endanger the collateral ratio; yet, it is very unlikely to see +/-20% gap on JPY/USD, but it is in theory possible. Nevertheless, due to gaps, a larger number of liquidation and disputes may arise on Sunday 9 pm UTC if the collateral ratio was already getting weaker before the week’s end. In order to mitigate this theoretical risk a high collateralization requirement (120%+) should be set or a reserve fund mechanism should be implemented in order to automatically rebalance the collateralization ratio above 100% (in case it falls below 100%), thus making the liquidation process profitable again.
