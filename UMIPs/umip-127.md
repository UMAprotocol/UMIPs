## Summary
The DVM should support price requests for the SGDUSD price index.

## Motivation
The DVM currently does not support this Forex price index.

### Cost: 
While Forex data are free through open centralized exchange, brokers, and other sources APIs, the most reliable are paid. We propose to use TraderMade's APIs whose pricing is accessible on their website. TraderMade has also a Free Tier which can be used by the voters and would be sufficient to provide the price of a certain asset.

### Opportunity: 
Synthetic tokens that track Forex pairs such as SGDUSD could be used both for speculations and hedging, but we see a bigger opportunity for using them as building blocks for helping other DeFi protocols and dApp addressing the global market.

## Technical Specification

The definition of the identifier should be:


- Identifier name: **SGDUSD**
- Base Currency: SGD
- Quote Currency: USD

-----------------------------------------

- Source: https://marketdata.tradermade.com
- Result Processing: None
- Input Processing: None. Human intervention in extreme circumstances where the result differs from broad market consensus.
- Price Steps: 0.00001 (5 decimals in more general trading format)
- Rounding: Closest, 0.5 up (>= .000005 rounds up, < .000005 rounds down)
- Scaling Decimals: 18 (1e18)
- Pricing Interval: 60 seconds
- Dispute timestamp rounding: down

## Rationale
Apart from the weekend, there is little to no difference in prices on liquid major Forex pairs, so any price feed could be used; however, for convenience, we recommend using the one of TraderMade.

## Implementation
Historical SGDUSD prices from TraderMade are available on minute increments. Price requests should use the minute price that is nearest and later than the price request timestamp. To do this, voters should use the open price of the OHLC period that the price request timestamp falls in. TraderMade endpoints are queried based on the OHLC period's close time.

As an example, a request for a SGDUSD price at 2020-11-11-01:52:16 should use query for the period ending at 2020-11-11-01:53:00 and use the open price. 

The TraderMade endpoint used would be: https://marketdata.tradermade.com/api/v1/minute_historical?currency=SGDUSD&date_time=2020-11-11-13:01&api_key=apikey

SGDUSD should then be rounded to 5 decimals.

TraderMade’s price feed is an aggregated feed from multiple Tier One and Two Banks, Market-Makers and Data Providers. They are popular with Quantitative Traders, Fintech companies and Institutional customers who require a high quality and trusted feed.

### Weekend timestamp

Over the weekend or some official holidays the REST API does not return any price, but we can request the price of a certain moment before the market close (as ex: the closing price of Friday).

Due to unavailability of price feed for foreign exchange rates and commodities over the weekend or during some official holidays, tokenholders and users will be using the latest known price, which for the weekend is essentially the closing price of Friday. Same goes in a case of a liquidation process - the liquidator should use the last known price (during the weekend this is the closing price of Friday) in order to match with the price on which a synthetic asset was created, if it was created over the weekend. If not the closing price on Friday for a certain asset should be a navigating point in calculating the collateralization ratio of a position and in the liquidation process.

If a request timestamp takes place on a weekend or any other day the Forex market is closed, voters should use the latest tick as the price. For the weekend that would be the closing price of the asset on Friday and for official holidays this would be the last know price provided by the price feed.

Please note that this is different than the normal calculation process, which requires using the open price of the period that the price request falls in.

### Forex markets working hours

Forex markets are usually open throughout business days from 10:00 PM UTC time on Sunday, until 9:00 PM UTC time on Friday. However it is good to note that some brokers might close their price feeds 5-10 minutes prior to the official market closing time, thus the latest price given from the broker will be used as a official price for the asset. We should also note here that during those minutes the price remains flat without any changes, however theoretically it is possible to have a stronger price movement.

### Price feed - liquidations and disputes

Liquidation and dispute bots should have their own subscription to price feeds. Our price-feed provider’s API documentation can be found [here](https://marketdata.tradermade.com/documentation). A reference TraderMade implementation that is used by liquidator and dispute bots can be seen [here](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/protocol/blob/master/packages/financial-templates-lib/src/price-feed/TraderMadePriceFeed.ts).

Our team has adjusted the original Liquidation and Dispute bots in order to fit the interfaces of our protocol. You can find our versions of the Liquidator and Dispute bots on the following GitLab links:

- [Liquidator Bot](https://gitlab.com/jarvis-network/apps/exchange/UMAprotocol/-/tree/jrv_bot/packages/liquidator/test)
- [Dispute Bot](https://gitlab.com/jarvis-network/apps/exchange/UMAprotocol/-/tree/jrv_bot/packages/disputer/test)

TraderMade is provided as an accessible source to query for this data, but ultimately how one queries for these rates should be varied and determined by the voter to ensure that there is no central point of failure.

In the case of a TraderMade outage voters can turn to any other available price feed API or a broker API, as the price feeds for the forementioned financial assets does not differ much between different providers. There might be some slight differences, however they are quite insignificant and would not affect the liquidation or dispute processes. For this case, we provide options for additional price feed providers that voters could utilize.

## Security considerations
Adding this new identifier by itself poses a little security risk to the DVM or priceless financial contract users. However, anyone deploying a new priceless token contract referencing this identifier should take care to parameterize the contract appropriately to avoid the loss of funds for synthetic token holders. Additionally, the contract deployer should ensure that there is a network of liquidators and disputers ready to perform the services necessary to keep the contract solvent.

While the price of SGDUSD or any other forex pair does not vary much across various price feed during the weekday, it may be more challenging to get a unified price feed on the weekend: first, while the underlying market is not closed, most of the broker and banks feeding the APIs price feed are; then, for the one providing a price feed, they often add a very big spread, which makes the price of forex pairs vary significantly by source; a way to mitigate it is to use the last price known. 

A consequence to this is the existence of gaps between the last quote on Friday to the first one on Sunday; while such gaps rarely exceed +/-2%, which should not put in danger the collateralization ratio, an exceptional event happening the weekend may create a bigger gap and could, in theory, endanger the collateral ratio; yet, it is very unlikely to see +/-20% gap, but it is in theory possible. Nevertheless, due to gaps, a larger number of liquidation and disputes may arise on Sunday 9 pm UTC if the collateral ratio was already getting weaker before the week’s end. In order to mitigate this theoretical risk a high collateralization requirement (120%+) should be set or a reserve fund mechanism should be implemented in order to automatically rebalance the collateralization ratio above 100% (in case it falls below 100%), thus making the liquidation process profitable again.
