# Summary (2-5 sentences)
This UMIP will add  LON, BANK, MASK, VSP, SFI, FRAX, ORN, BOND and PUNK-BASIC as approved collateral currencies.
This will involve adding each of these tokens to the whitelist and adding flat final fees to charge per-request.

# Motivation

Adding a collection of popular and liquid ERC20 tokens as collateral types will allow for a variety of contract deployments. These could be used with ERC20/USD price identifiers that are also being proposed to create yield dollars or covered calls collateralized by each of these tokens, among many other use cases.

Proactively approving these collateral types and price feeds will make it easier for development teams and protocol treasuries to create new products using these ERC20 tokens.

# Proposed Collateral Currencies
Note : The final fee for all ERC20 tokens will be ~$400 at time of writing

# Security considerations

These ERC20 tokens have shown to be persistently valuable given their liquidity and market capitalization, so including them as collateral currencies should impose no additional risk to the protocol.

The only security implication is for contract deployers and users who are considering using EMP contracts with these tokens as the collateral currency. They should recognize that, relative to most fiat currencies, these assets are much more volatile. This volatility should be taken into account when parameterizing or using these EMP contracts.
