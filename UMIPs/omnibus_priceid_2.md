# Summary

The DVM should support price requests for

- BASKUSD
- USDBASK
- MPHUSD
- USDMPH
- APWUSD
- USDAPW
- SNOWUSD
- USDSNOW
- NDXUSD
- USDNDX

The canonical identifiers should be:
`BASKUSD` , `USDBASK` , `MPHUSD` , `USDMPH` , `APWUSD` , `USDAPW` , `SNOWUSD` , `USDSNOW` , `NDXUSD` , and `USDNDX`.

# Motivation

Adding these price identifiers allows the use of the base currencies as collateral for minting synthetics or call options.

Any of the base currencies could be used to mint yield dollars or other synthetics, and liquidators could identify undercollateralized positions by comparing the USD value of the locked collateral.
Base currency call options could be minted and paid out based on the USD price of the base currency at expiry.
KPI options tied to the price of the base currency could be minted, with a payout increasing as the base currency price increases.

## TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

### BASK/USD

**Price Identifier Name:** BASKUSD

**Base Currency:** BASK

**Quote currency:** USD

**Intended Collateral Currency:** USDC

**Scaling Decimals:** 18 (1e18)

**Rounding:** Round to nearest 6 decimal places (seventh decimal place digit >= 5 rounds up and < 5 rounds down)

**Does the value of this collateral currency match the standalone value of the listed quote currency?:** Yes.

**Is your collateral currency already approved to be used by UMA financial contracts?:** Yes.

### USD/BASK

**Price Identifier Name:** USDBASK

**Base Currency:** USD

**Quote currency:** BASK

**Intended Collateral Currency:** BASK

**Scaling Decimals:** 18 (1e18)

**Rounding:** Round to nearest 6 decimal places (seventh decimal place digit >= 5 rounds up and < 5 rounds down)

**Does the value of this collateral currency match the standalone value of the listed quote currency?:** Yes.

**Is your collateral currency already approved to be used by UMA financial contracts?:** In progress.

## IMPLEMENTATION

Voters should query for the price of BASK/ETH on SushiSwap and the ETHUSD price as specified via UMIP-6. Recommended endpoints are provided in the markets and data sources section.

```
1. Query the BASK/ETH price from SushiSwap using 15-minute TWAP.
2. Query the ETH/USD price as per UMIP-6.
3. Multiply the BASK/ETH price by the ETH/USD price and round to 6 decimals to get the BASK/USD price.
4. The result from step 5 should be rounded to six decimals to determine the BASKUSD price.
5. (for USD/BASK) Take the inverse of the result of step 3, before rounding, (1/ BASK/USD) to get the USD/BASK price, and round to 6 decimals.
```

For both implementations, voters should determine whether the returned price differs from broad market consensus. This is meant to provide flexibility in any unforeseen circumstances as voters are responsible for defining broad market consensus.

## SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

Audited by Haechi

https://github.com/basketdao/contracts/tree/main/audits

This project is currently in Beta testing. Additionally, the inclusion of only a single market makes this subject to possible manipulation $UMA holders should evaluate the ongoing cost and benefit of supporting this asset as a collateral if liquidity concerns are identified. UMA holders should take note of the collaterals nature as liquidity, if the collateral changes, or if added robustness(e.g., via TWAPs) are necessary to prevent market manipulation.

## Technical Specifications

### SNOW/USD

**Price Identifier Name:** SNOWUSD

**Base Currency:** SNOW

**Quote currency:** USD

**Intended Collateral Currency:** USDC

**Scaling Decimals:** 18 (1e18)

**Rounding:** Round to nearest 6 decimal places (seventh decimal place digit >= 5 rounds up and < 5 rounds down)

**Does the value of this collateral currency match the standalone value of the listed quote currency?:** Yes.

**Is your collateral currency already approved to be used by UMA financial contracts?:** Yes.

### USD/SNOW

**Price Identifier Name:** USDSNOW

**Base Currency:** USD

**Quote currency:** SNOW

**Intended Collateral Currency:** SNOW

**Scaling Decimals:** 18 (1e18)

**Rounding:** Round to nearest 6 decimal places (seventh decimal place digit >= 5 rounds up and < 5 rounds down)

**Does the value of this collateral currency match the standalone value of the listed quote currency?:** Yes.

**Is your collateral currency already approved to be used by UMA financial contracts?:** Yes.

## Implementation

```
1. For the cryptowatch endpoint, voters should use the open price of the 1 minute OHLC period that the timestamp falls in for Gate.io
2. Query the SNOW/ETH price from Uniswap using 15-minute TWAP.
3. Query the ETH/USD price as per UMIP-6.
4. Multiply the SNOW/ETH price by the ETH/USD price and round to 6 decimals to get the SNOW/USD price.
5. The median of Steps 1 and 4 should be taken.
6. The result from step 5 should be rounded to six decimals to determine the SNOWUSD price.
7. (for USD/SNOW) Take the inverse of the result of step 5, before rounding, (1/ SNOW/USD) to get the USD/BAND price, and round to 6 decimals.
```

The SNOW protocol is in Beta. $UMA holders should evaluate the ongoing cost and benefit of supporting this asset as a collateral if liquidity concerns are identified. UMA holders should take note of this collateral nature as liquidity, if the collateral changes, or if added robustness(e.g., via TWAPs) are necessary to prevent market manipulation

Uniswap Query:

```
{
 pair(
  id:"0x46af8ac1b82f73db6aacc1645d40c56191ab787b",

## Price Feed Implementation

These price identifiers use the [UniswapPriceFeed](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/protocol/blob/master/packages/financial-templates-lib/src/price-feed/UniswapPriceFeed.js) and [ExpressionPriceFeed](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/protocol/blob/master/packages/financial-templates-lib/src/price-feed/ExpressionPriceFeed.js).

## Implementation

```
1. Query NDX/ETH Price from Uniswap using 15-minute TWAP.
2. Query the ETH/USD Price as per UMIP-6 from for the timestamp requested.
3. Multiply the result from step 1 by the ETH/USD price from step 2 and round to 6 decimals to get the NDX/USD price.
4. (for USD/NDX) Take the inverse of the result of step 3 (1/ NDX/USD), before rounding, to get the USD/NDX price. Then, round to 6 decimals.
```

## Security Considerations

Relative to most fiat currencies, NDX is much more volatile and is very nascent (March 2021) in the Ethereum ecosystem. It also has poor liquidity at this time, being traded almost exclusively on Uniswap. Liquidation should improve as tokens are distributed, but at the time NDX is very concentrated to the NDX governance organization. Contract developers should exercise extreme caution when parameterizing EMP contracts using NDX as a collateral currency

$UMA-holders should evaluate the ongoing cost and benefit of supporting this asset as collateral and also contemplate removing support of this collateral if liquidity concerns are identified. $UMA-holders should take note of the collateral’s nature as liquidity of the collateral changes, or if added robustness (e.g., via TWAPs) are necessary to prevent market manipulation
