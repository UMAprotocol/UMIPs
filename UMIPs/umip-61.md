# SUMMARY 

The DVM should support price requests for the below price indexes:
- DIGG/BTC
- DIGG/ETH
- DIGG/USD

# MOTIVATION

The DVM currently does not support the DIGG/BTC, DIGG/ETH or DIGG/USD price identifiers.

DIGG is an elastic supply token pegged to the price of Bitcoin and governed by the Badger DAO. DIGG is currently pegged to 1 BTC, and uses a custom oracle to determine the necessary change in supply. If DIGG price is above 1.05 BTC, DIGG supply increases. This is known as a positive rebase. If DIGG price is below 0.95 BTC, DIGG supply decreases. This is known as a negative rebase. If DIGG price is between 0.95 and 1.05 BTC, DIGG does not rebase. Every DIGG holder gets the same increase or decrease in supply every rebase.

Supporting the ability to obtain price exposure of DIGG against BTC, ETH, and USD would allow traders to hedge, speculate, and obtain long/short exposure while retaining WBTC or ETH exposure. Many users of these synthetic assets may be Badger yield farmers who want to hedge or arbitrage the DIGG rate. An example of someone who may want to use DIGGBTC would be when the DIGG price is higher than BTC and a trader has DIGG exposure earning a high annual yield along with the inflation rewards described above. Instead of selling DIGG, a user can hedge their DIGG exposure by keeping DIGG and separately using the UMA approved collateral types described in the Technical Specifications to mint DIGGBTC synthetic tokens and sell to the market. If the DIGGBTC rate decreases the user is able to buy DIGGBTC tokens back for less and receive their collateral at a lower DIGGBTC rate. In the opposite situation where DIGG is trading below the Bitcoin price, a DIGGBTC synthetic may be an attractive option for traders who believe the DIGGBTC rate will increase but do not want to be exposed to the daily rebases. 

In both of these situations the exchange rate of DIGG may be impacted by the rebases. However, the synthetic token only exposes the user to the price of DIGG against BTC/ETH/USD. The supply of the collateral used to mint the synthetic tokens (WBTC/USDC/WETH) and the synthetic tokens (DIGGBTC/DIGGETH/DIGGUSD) do not change based on the DIGG rebases.

The Marketcap of DIGG is currently around $75 million. What makes synthetic DIGG interesting is the game theory behind DIGG, the volatility of both the BTC and DIGG prices, along with yield farmers being able to use these synthetics to hedge their DIGG exposure.

# RATIONALE

**Why this implementation of the identifier as opposed to other implementation designs?**

This implementation is due to DIGG's main sources of liquidity being on Sushiswap and Uniswap.  Currently, only one low volume and low depth centralized exchange has DIGG listed, and most liquidity will remain on DEXs as it is incentivized.

**What analysis can you provide on where to get the most robust prices? (Robust as in legitimate liquidity, legitimate volume, price discrepancies between exchanges, and trading volume between exchanges)**

Sushiswap and Uniswap have the vast majority of DIGG volume and depth.  These should be used over all other sources.

**What is the potential for the price to be manipulated on the chosen exchanges?**

DIGG is not a collateral on any loan services and the majority of the liquidity is locked into farming vaults.  The potential risk for this is low.

**Should the prices have any processing (e.g., TWAP)?**

A 30 minute TWAP was chosen to help smooth out price changes and give sponsors time to react before becoming undercollateralized. A 30 minute TWAP will also mitigate risk of attempted price manipulation attempts on the market price of the synthetic. To meaningfully manipulate the price that token sponsors’ collateralization is calculated with, an attacker would have to manipulate the trading price of a token for an extended amount of time. Another factor influencing the TWAP decision is the daily rebase and its potential impact on the supply and exchange rate which is described further in the Security Considerations section.

A 24 hour TWAP was chosen for DIGGBTC to be applicable as a price oracle for DIGG rebases.

<br>

# IMPLEMENTATION

For all implementations, a block number will need to be used. The block number should be the block that is closest to and before the timestamp that the price request timestamp.

For DIGG/ETH and DIGG/USD TWAP implementations, the TWAP start time should be determined by the latest block 30 minutes before requested timestamp. For DIGG/BTC, it should be 24 hours before. When using DIGG/BTC in DIGG/ETH and DIGG/USD price calculations, a 30 minute TWAP should be used for DIGG/BTC.

**For DIGG/WBTC**

    1. Query DIGG/WBTC Price from Sushiswap using 24 hour TWAP (0x9a13867048e01c663ce8ce2fe0cdae69ff9f35e3).
    2. Query DIGG/WBTC Price from Uniswap using 24 hour TWAP (0xe86204c4eddd2f70ee00ead6805f917671f56c52).
    3. Take the mean of steps 1 and 2 to get the DIGG/WBTC price. This result should have 8 decimals, rounding the closest 0.5 up.

**For DIGG/ETH**

    1. Query DIGG/WBTC Price from Sushiswap using 30 minute TWAP (0x9a13867048e01c663ce8ce2fe0cdae69ff9f35e3).
    2. Query DIGG/WBTC Price from Uniswap using 30 minute TWAP (0xe86204c4eddd2f70ee00ead6805f917671f56c52).
    3. Query WBTC/ETH Price from Sushiswap using 30 minute TWAP (0xceff51756c56ceffca006cd410b03ffc46dd3a58).
    4. Query WBTC/ETH Price from Uniswap using 30 minute TWAP (0xbb2b8038a1640196fbe3e38816f3e67cba72d940).
    5. Take the mean of steps 1 and 2 to get the DIGG/WBTC price.
    6. Take the mean of steps 3 and 4 to get the WBTC/ETH price.
    7. Multiply steps 5 and 6 and round to 8 decimal places to get the final DIGG/ETH price. 


**For DIGG/USD**

    1. Query DIGG/WBTC Price from Sushiswap using 30 minute TWAP (0x9a13867048e01c663ce8ce2fe0cdae69ff9f35e3).

    6. Take the mean of steps 1 and 2 to get the DIGG/WBTC price. 
    7. Take the mean of steps 3 and 4 to get the WBTC/ETH price.
    8. Multiply steps 6 and 7 to get the DIGG/ETH price.

# Security considerations

Adding this new identifier by itself poses little security risk to the DVM or priceless financial contract users. However, anyone deploying a new priceless token contract referencing this identifier should take care to parameterize the contract appropriately to the reference asset’s volatility and liquidity characteristics to avoid the loss of funds for synthetic token holders. Additionally, the contract deployer should ensure that there is a network of liquidators and disputers ready to perform the services necessary to keep the contract solvent.

Token price manipulation - Under illiquid market conditions, an attacker could attempt to drive prices down to withdraw more collateral than normally allowed or drive prices up to trigger liquidations. However, it is important to note that almost all attacks that have been performed on DeFi projects are executed with flash loans, which allows the attacker to obtain leverage and instantaneously manipulate a price and extract collateral. Additionally, flash loans will have no effect on a tradeable token price because the TWAP calculation is measured based on the price at the end of each block. Collateralization based off of a TWAP should make these attacks ineffective and would require attackers to use significantly more capital and take more risk to exploit any vulnerabilities.

DIGG Rebase - When the DIGG supply policy executes its rebase, all DIGG holders balances potentially increase or decrease together in a single transaction which include contracts that hold DIGG balances (Uniswap and Sushiswap). Since the DIGG reserve automatically adjusts, changing the relative size of the DIGG in pools, a new exchange rate is created. Having a 30 minute TWAP will allow the price to adjust after larger supply changes and prevent a higher risk of undercollateralized positions.

Collateralization Requirements - All three of these identifiers are very volatile which brings on a higher risk of undercollateralized positions in the case of a massive DIGG price increase. Minimum collateral ratios should be higher compared with other price identifiers with ~1.5 being the minimum.

$UMA-holders should evaluate the ongoing cost and benefit of supporting price requests for this identifier and also contemplate de-registering this identifier if security holes are identified. As noted above, $UMA-holders should also consider re-defining this identifier as liquidity in the underlying asset changes, or if added robustness are necessary to prevent market manipulation.
