- UMIP title: Add Variable Expiring MultiParty (VEMP) financial contract template
- Author: Prelaunch Team, dev@prelaunch.finance

## Summary (2-5 sentences)
Due to necessity and after discussing with the UMA team, their ExpiringMultiParty contract was modified to support variable expiration from an application specific authorized DAO address. Other projects such as Synthereum have needed a custom solution for this use case in the past. This financial contract template will be available for any projects on UMA to use. The main contract that was modified is PricelessPositionManager.sol.

## Motivation
The current implementation of the ExpiringMultiParty (EMP) contract accepts a fixed expiration at the time of creation, which cannot be modified. In our use case, we needed the Prelaunch DAO to be able to expire the contract at a specific unknown future time in response to unpredictable events and factors. With the Variable EMP contract proposed, the Prelaunch DAO will be able to expire the contract at a final price after a vote of token holders votes favorably. As a backup, the contract will still expire at the expiration time set at creation. 

## Technical Specification
The main contract that was modified is PricelessPositionManager.sol, Available here: https://github.com/PrelaunchFinance/VEMP/blob/main/contracts/PricelessPositionManager.sol

The diff files showing the modifications of all files compared to the EMP contract can be found here: https://github.com/PrelaunchFinance/VEMP/tree/main/diffs

Below is an overview of the significant changes made in PricelessPositionManager.sol.

Here we add an update timestanp to represent when the DAO address was last changed.

## Rationale
Prelaunch finance is a platform for prelaunch synthetic assets. These assets need to expire shortly after they go live on the market, however the exact dates are always up in the air and often delayed or changed. Therefore we designed this implementation to have a smooth way of expiring prelaunch synthetic assets at the right time and price.

An alternative design where the expiration would be set via UMA vote was considered. We decided to use an application specific governance model to support a wider variety of situations and reduce the burden on UMA voters. 

## Implementation

## Security considerations
Few lines of code were added. Therefore the potential surface area for an exploit is low, particularly as we receive feedback from the community and UMA team. However, we may pursue an audit in the future.

Per feedback from the UMA team we decided to use the Optimistic Oracle for the final price determination, so that the third party DAO address only has the authority to expire the contract but not determine the expiry price.

We included the updateDAOAddress function to minimize potential issues with the application specific external DAO contract. However, the security of the DAO is important as the VEMP contract could be prematurely or belatedly expired.
