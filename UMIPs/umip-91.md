# SUMMARY

The DVM should support price requests for the below price indices:
- LON/USD
- USD/LON
- BANK/USD
- USD/BANK
- MASK/USD
- USD/MASK
- VSP/USD
- USD/VSP
- SFI/USD
- USD/SFI
- DEXTF/USD
- USD/DEXTF
- ORN/USD
- USD/ORN
- BOND/USD
- USD/BOND 
- PUNK-BASIC/USD
- USD/PUNK-BASIC

The canonical identifiers should be `LONUSD`, `USDLON`, `BANKUSD`, `USDBANK`, `MASKUSD`, `USDMASK`, `VSPUSD`, `USDVSP`, `SFIUSD`, `USDSFI`,  `DEXTFUSD`, `USDDEXTF`, `ORNUSD`, `USDORN`, `BONDUSD`, `USDBOND`, `PUNK-BASICUSD` and `USDPUNK-BASIC`.
# MOTIVATION

1. What are the financial positions enabled by adding these price identifiers that do not already exist?

- These price identifiers allow the use of the base currencies as collateral for minting synthetics or call options. See also [the related collateral UMIP](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/UMIPs/blob/master/UMIPs/umip-82.md).

2. Please provide an example of a person interacting with a contract that uses these price identifiers.

- Any of the base currencies could be used to mint yield dollars or other synthetics, and liquidators could identify undercollateralized positions by comparing the USD value of the synthetic to the value of the locked collateral.
- Base currency call options could be minted and paid out based on the USD price of the base currency at expiry.
- KPI options tied to the price of the base currency could be minted, with a payout increasing as the base currency price increases.

# RATIONALE

All of these base currencies have deep liquidity on Uniswap, SushiSwap, or both, and some have good liquidity on centralized exchanges, as well. The specifications for each price identifier are based on how we can find the most accurate price for the base currency. So, if a token has deep liquidity and high volume on Uniswap but little or no CEX activity, we would use a Uniswap TWAP. If a token has deep liquidity and high volume on two CEXs and Uniswap, we would take the median of the three prices (with a TWAP for Uniswap).

# LON

## MARKETS & DATA SOURCES

**Required questions**

Market: OKEx, Uniswap, SushiSwap

* OKEx LON/USDT: https://api.cryptowat.ch/markets/okex/lonusdt/price
* SUSHISWAP LON/USDT: https://analytics.sushi.com/pairs/0x55d31f68975e446a40a2d02ffa4b0e1bfb233c2f
* UNISWAP LON/ETH: https://v2.info.uniswap.org/pair/0x7924a818013f39cf800f5589ff1f1f0def54f31f


How often is the provided price updated?

   - The lower bound on the price update frequency is a minute.

Provide recommended endpoints to query for historical prices from each market listed.

* OKEx: https://api.cryptowat.ch/markets/okex/lonusdt/ohlc?after=1617848822&before=1617848822&periods=60


Do these sources allow for querying up to 74 hours of historical data?

   - Yes.

How often is the provided price updated?

   - Every 60 seconds for CW. Every block for Uniswap and Sushiswap.

Is an API key required to query these sources?

   - CW has a free tier, but requires an API key beyond that.

Is there a cost associated with usage?

   - Yes. Cryptowatch requires a purchase of credits beyond their free tier.

If there is a free tier available, how many queries does it allow for?

   - The free tier is limited to 10 API credits per 24-hours; the cost of querying the market price of a given exchange is 0.005 API credits.
   - Therefore, querying exchange can be performed 2000 times per day.
   - In other words, exchange can be queried at most every 43 seconds.

What would be the cost of sending 15,000 queries?

    - Approximately $5

## PRICE FEED IMPLEMENTATION

These price identifiers use the [CryptoWatchPriceFeed](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/protocol/blob/master/packages/financial-templates-lib/src/price-feed/CryptoWatchPriceFeed.js).
[ExpressionPriceFeed](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/protocol/blob/master/packages/financial-templates-lib/src/price-feed/ExpressionPriceFeed.js).

## TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

### LON/USD

**Price Identifier Name:** LONUSD

**Base Currency:** LON

**Quote currency:** USD

**Intended Collateral Currency:** USDC

**Scaling Decimals:** 18 (1e18)

**Rounding:** Round to nearest 6 decimal places (seventh decimal place digit >= 5 rounds up and < 5 rounds down)

**Does the value of this collateral currency match the standalone value of the listed quote currency?:** Yes.

**Is your collateral currency already approved to be used by UMA financial contracts?:** Yes.

### USD/LON

**Price Identifier Name:** USDLON

**Base Currency:** USD

**Quote currency:** LON

**Intended Collateral Currency:** LON

**Scaling Decimals:** 18 (1e18)

**Rounding:** Round to nearest 6 decimal places (seventh decimal place digit >= 5 rounds up and < 5 rounds down)

**Does the value of this collateral currency match the standalone value of the listed quote currency?:** Yes.

**Is your collateral currency already approved to be used by UMA financial contracts?:** In progress.

## IMPLEMENTATION

Voters should query for the price of LON/USD at the price request timestamp on OKEx. Recommended endpoints are provided in the markets and data sources section.

1. For the price request timestamp, query for the LON/USDT price on Okex. The open price of the 60-second OHLC period that this price request timestamp falls in should be used.
2. Query the ETHUSD price by following the guidelines of UMIP-6.
3. Query LON/USDT Price from Sushiswap using 5 minute TWAP.
4. Query LON/ETH Price from Uniswap using 5 minute TWAP.
5. Take the median of the price from step 1 , step 3 and result of the multiplication of step 4 * step 2.
6. The result should be rounded to six decimals to determine the LONUSD price.
7. (for USD/LON) Take the inverse of the result of step 5 (1/ LON/USD), before rounding, to get the USD/LON price, and round to 6 decimals.

For both implementations, voters should determine whether the returned price differs from broad market consensus. This is meant to provide flexibility in any unforeseen circumstances as voters are responsible for defining broad market consensus.

   - Yes. Cryptowatch requires a purchase of credits beyond their free tier.

If there is a free tier available, how many queries does it allow for?

   - The free tier is limited to 10 API credits per 24-hours; the cost of querying the market price of a given exchange is 0.005 API credits.
   - Therefore, querying the exchange can be performed 2000 times per day.
   - In other words, exchange can be queried at most every 43 seconds.

What would be the cost of sending 15,000 queries?

    - Approximately $5

## IMPLEMENTATION

Voters should query for the price of ORN/USD at the price request timestamp. Recommended endpoints are provided in the markets and data sources section.

1. Query for the ORN/USDT price from Binance. The open price of the 60-second OHLC period that this price request timestamp falls in should be used.
2. Query for the ORN/BTC price from Binance.
3. Following the guidelines in [UMIP-7](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/UMIPs/blob/master/UMIPs/umip-7.md), query for the BTC/USD price.
4. Multiply the results of steps 2 and 3 to get an ORN/USD Binance price.
5. For the block of the price request timestamp, query for the ORNETH price from Uniswap using a 5-minute TWAP.
6. Following the guidelines in [UMIP-6](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/UMIPs/blob/master/UMIPs/umip-6.md), query for the ETH/USD price.
7. Multiply the gathered ETHUSD price by ORNETH to get the Uniswap ORNUSD price.
8. Take the median of the results from steps 1, 4 and 7. 
9. Round to 6 decimals to get the ORNUSD price.
10. To get the USDORN price, voters should just take the inverse of the result of Step 8 (unrounded ORNUSD price) then round to 6 decimal places.



For both implementations, voters should determine whether the returned price differs from broad market consensus. This is meant to provide flexibility in any unforeseen circumstances as voters are responsible for defining broad market consensus.

# Security considerations

Adding these new identifiers by themselves poses little security risk to the DVM or priceless financial contract users. However, anyone deploying a new priceless token contract referencing this identifier should take care to parameterize the contract appropriately to the reference asset’s volatility and liquidity characteristics to avoid the loss of funds for synthetic token holders. Additionally, the contract deployer should ensure that there is a network of liquidators and disputers ready to perform the services necessary to keep the contract solvent.

$UMA-holders should evaluate the ongoing cost and benefit of supporting price requests for these identifiers and also contemplate de-registering these identifiers if security holes are identified. As noted above, $UMA-holders should also consider re-defining these identifiers as liquidity in the underlying asset changes, or if added robustness (e.g. via TWAPs) are necessary to prevent market manipulation.
