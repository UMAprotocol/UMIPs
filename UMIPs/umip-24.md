 - Title: Add DEFI_PULSE_TOTAL_TVL and SUSHIUNI_TVL as supported price identifiers
 - Author:  Bryan Campbell (bryanjcampbell1@gmail.com)
 - Status: Approved
 - Created: November, 15, 2020


## Summary
The DVM should support price requests for the following Total Value Locked (TVL) derivatives:

1) Sum of TVL for all projects on DeFi Pulse divided by 1,000,000,000
2) 10 multiplied by the ratio of TVL of Sushi Swap over Uniswap



## Motivation

The DVM currently does not support the previously mentioned price indices.
Adding TVL identifiers enables the creation of synthetic assets with a price that tracks the actual use of a DeFi protocol.  This stands in sharp contrast to the wild price swings DeFi governance tokens that are often uncorrelated to the use of the protocol.  The SUSHI/UNI ratio derivative is unique in that it tracks the relative health of two protocols.

- Intended Collateral Type: USDC
- Scaling Decimals: 18 (1e18)
- Pricing Interval: 60 minutes
- Dispute timestamp rounding: down 


### SUSHIUNI_TVL
- Quote Currency: None. This is a ratio.
- Source: https://data.defipulse.com/
- Result Processing: None
- Input Processing: None. Human intervention in extreme circumstances where the result differs from broad consensus.
- Rounding: Round to nearest 3 decimal places (fourth decimal place digit >= 5 rounds up and < 5 rounds down)
- Intended Collateral Type: USDC
- Scaling Decimals: 18 (1e18)
- Pricing Interval: 60 minutes
- Dispute timestamp rounding: down 


## Rationale

Price of DeFi Pulse API is free at Trial level and 95 USD for the Starter level.
It would require 200 GET requests per month in order to use up the credits offered at the Trial level.
At the time of writing, DeFi Pulse’s metrics are the most popular for measuring a project’s TVL. 

## Implementation (DEFI_PULSE_TOTAL_TVL)

The following procedure uses DeFi Pulse Data API.  The API docs can be found at https://docs.defipulse.com/api-docs-by-provider/defi-pulse-data/total-value-locked/total-value-locked


1) Sign up for the free Trial account from https://data.defipulse.com/
2) Call the API with https://data-api.defipulse.com/api/v1/defipulse/api/GetHistory?period=1w&api-key=********

The response object is an array of TVL values at hourly increments over the past week.

3) Find the object in the response array with a timestamp that is nearest, and earlier than, the price request timestamp.

4) The value at the key “tvlUSD” is the TVL that we want
5) Divide the value found at step 4 by 1,000,000,000 to get the settlement value of the DEFI_PULSE_TOTAL_TVL price identifier


## Implementation (SUSHIUNI_TVL)
The following procedure uses DeFi Pulse Data API.  The API docs can be found at https://docs.defipulse.com/api-docs-by-provider/defi-pulse-data/total-value-locked/total-value-locked

1) Sign up for the free Trial account from https://data.defipulse.com/
2) Call the API with https://data-api.defipulse.com/api/v1/defipulse/api/GetHistory?project=sushiswap&period=1w&api-key=********

The response object is an array of TVL values at hourly increments over the past week.

3) Find the object in the response array that corresponds to timestamp equal to time the synthetic token expired
4) The value at the key “tvlUSD” is the TVL that we want
5) Repeat steps 1 through 4 with “uniswap” in place of “sushiswap” in the GET request
6) Divide the sushiswap TVL by the uniswapTVL and multiply by 10 to get the settlement value of the SUSHIUNI_TVL price identifier

At current TVL values, Uniswap has a higher TVL than SushiSwap.  The scale factor of 10 is used to keep the value of SUSHIUNI_TVL above 1 while  still being directly proportional to the ratio of TVL between the protocols.
 

## ## Backup Calculation of DEFI_PULSE_TOTAL_TVL 


In the case that the the value from DeFi Pulse for DEFI_PULSE_TOTAL_TVL at expiration is determined to differ from broad market consensus, the following is an example of how voters could arrive at a backup measurement of DEFI_PULSE_TOTAL_TVL.

1) Gather all DEFI_PULSE_TOTAL_TVL values from timestamps corresponding to the day the synthetic token expires
2) Determine which values are contentious off chain 
3) Remove contentious values 
4) Average the remaining values to get the settlement value 

## Backup Calculation of SUSHIUNI_TVL

In the case that the the values from DeFi Pulse for SushiSwap or Uniswap are determined to differ from broad market consensus, the following is an example of how votors could arrive at a backup measurement of SUSHIUNI_TVL.

Note: The following procedure uses a daily value of TVL as opposed to an hourly value

1) Go to the Uniswap Subgraph, https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/uniswap/uniswap-v2
2)  Determine Id corresponding to the day that the synthetic token expires using the following
    
    ID = (unix timestamp for start of day) / 86400 
    
3) Run the following query, replacing ID with the number you found in step 2, to get the TVL of Uniswap

    {
        uniswapDayData(id:ID) 
        {
            totalLiquidityUSD
        }
    }
    
4) Go to the Sushiswap Subgraph, https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/jiro-ono/sushiswap-exchange
5) Run the following query, replacing ID with the number you found in step 2, to get the TVL of Sushiswap
    
    {
        dayData(id:ID) 
        {
            liquidityUSD
        }
    }

6) Divide the value from step 5 by the value at step 3 and multiply by 10 to get the settlement value of the SUSHIUNI_TVL price identifier



## Security Considerations

There are concerns around using DeFi Pulse data as the primary source for determining price feeds. 

1) DeFi Pulse alone is not decentralized enough
2) DeFi Pulse is not fully transparent in how they calculate TVL
3) DeFi Pulse is fairly arbitrarily choosing what platforms to include in their calculation      

In the future it may be beneficial for the UMA community to develop our own, more transparent and decentralized calculation of TVL.

On the other hand, DeFi Pulse's TVL metric is so commonly referenced in larger crypto community that, for many, their metric defines TVL.  For that reason, even if we do decide to develop our own TVL All metric, the market may still see the need for a DEFI_PULSE_TOTAL_TVL derivative that tokenizes DeFi Pulse's calculations. 

If DeFi Pulse suspends their api service a new price feed source will have to be determined.  The Graph and Dune Analytics offer alternatives for independent measurements.  Taking a median value was considered but due to the lack of standardization of the metric, values between DeFi Pulse, Graph, and Dune were often more than an order of magnitude apart. Appropriate scaling could be applied in the future with the development of a UMA community TVL metric.

There are likely some security considerations around using a price feed that is available with an hourly granularity. Contract creators should likely specify longer liquidation and withdrawal liveness times to allow for prices to be accurately reported. There could be large jumps in price resulting from the 1 hour lag that could result in unexpected liquidations for token sponsors.
