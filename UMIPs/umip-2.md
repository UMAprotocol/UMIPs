## Summary (2-5 sentences)
"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." 
Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the issue.

## Motivation
The motivation is critical to change the UMA protocol. 
It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate with respect to the issue raised.

## Technical Specification
The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of the proposed solution for the issue raised. 
If a suggestion is proposed, provide sufficient details so that an implementation would be possible (Proof of Concepts are acceptable).

## Rationale
The rationale should flesh out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made, as well as any alternative designs that were considered.

## Implementation
An implementation must be completed before any UMIP proceeds to “Last Call” status.

## Security considerations
All UMIPs must include a discussion of the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change as well as proposed mitigations. 
A UMIP cannot proceed to “Final” status without a sufficient security review from the core team.
