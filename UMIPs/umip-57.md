<br>

# Overview
This proposal is for adding the following price identifiers to be supported:

 * AAVEUSD, USDAAVE
 * LINKUSD, USDLINK
 * SNXUSD, USDSNX
 * UMAUSD, USDUMA
 * UNIUSD, USDUNI

# Motivation

The purpose of adding these price identifiers is to be able to mint synthetic tokens priced at the defi protocol's token valued against USD. By doing so, users who mint synthetic tokens and sell them to the market are able to short the protocol. Similarly, users who buy the synthetic token are able to long the protocol.

If the inverse price identifier is used (e.g. USD/UMA) and the same altcoin token is employed as collateral, then the value of the synthetic token can be traded in place of the underlying collateral without having to sell the underlying asset.  

# Rationale
For each altcoin token, we choose to have both `XYZUSD` and `USDXYZ` price identifiers (where the symbol `XYZ` is either `AAVE`, `LINK`, `SNX`, `UMA`, `UNI`) to allow for financial products that use either the altcoin token or stable USDC as collateral.
 * Using USDC as collateral allows for speculating on the price of `XYZUSD` -- risking liquidation if the price of the altcoin increases relative to USD.
 * Using the altcoin as collateral allows for borrowing synthetic USDC equivalents tracking `USDXYZ` -- risking liquidation if altcoin *decreases* in value relative to USD.

We picked the top 3 exchanges by trading volume to avoid price movements solely to do poor liquidity.

A time interval of 1 minute is the most granular time interval supported by the API. We choose a small time interval to ensure that positions track with any large price movements that may occur -- given that this may be a volatile instrument.

We choose to use a median of three exchanges to balance the overhead of additionally required API calls for liquidation bots between an increased sample size of market prices. The median of the prices was choose instead of a simple arithmetic average to handle the scenarios where a given exchange is halted, unresponsive, or has erratic price movement.

Quoted prices in USD are rounded to 6 amounts since (i) the USDC ERC20 contract only has 6 decimal places, and (ii) most exchanges only quote prices in USD between 2 to 6 decimal places. We've done the same (i.e. round to 6 decimal places) as well for all `USDXYZ` inverse price identifier for implementation and voting simplicity.

# AAVE (Aave Token)

## Summary
The DVM should support price requests for the AAVE/USD, USD/AAVE price index.

## Motivation
The DVM currently does not support the AAVE/USD or USD/AAVE index.

Cost: Pricing for this index is easy to access through open centralized exchange APIs, and cross-exchange price discrepancies are typically negligible.

## Markets & Data Sources
Coinbase Pro, Binance, and OKEx should be used to construct the price. These 3 exchanges comprise a significant amount of AAVE trade volume and have available pricefeeds on Cryptowatch.

 1. Which specific pairs should be queried from each market?

    - Coinbase Pro: AAVE/USD
    - Binance: AAVE/USDT
    - OKEx: AAVE/USDT

 2. Provide recommended endpoints to query for real-time prices from each market listed.

    - Coinbase Pro AAVE/USD: <https://api.cryptowat.ch/markets/coinbase-pro/aaveusd/price>
    - Binance AAVE/USDT: <https://api.cryptowat.ch/markets/binance/aaveusdt/price>
    - OKEx AAVE/USDT: <https://api.cryptowat.ch/markets/okex/aaveusdt/price>

 3. How often is the provided price updated?

    - The lower bound on the price update frequency is a minute.

 4. Provide recommended endpoints to query for historical prices from each market listed.

    - Coinbase Pro: <https://api.cryptowat.ch/markets/coinbase-pro/aaveusd/ohlc?after=1613450520&before=1613450520&periods=60>
    - Binance: <https://api.cryptowat.ch/markets/binance/aaveusdt/ohlc?after=1613450520&before=1613450520&periods=60>
    - OKEx: <https://api.cryptowat.ch/markets/okex/aaveusdt/ohlc?after=1613450520&before=1613450520&periods=60>

 5. Do these sources allow for querying up to 74 hours of historical data?

    - Yes

 6. How often is the provided price updated?

    - The lower bound on the price update frequency is a minute.

 7. Is an API key required to query these sources?

    - No

 8. Is there a cost associated with usage?

    - Yes

 9. If there is a free tier available, how many queries does it allow for?

    - The free tier is limited to 10 API credits per 24-hours; the cost of querying the market price of a given exchange is 0.005 API credits (i.e. querying all three exchanges will cost 0.015 API credits). 
    - Therefore, querying all three exchanges can be performed 665 times per day.  
    - In other words, all three exchanges can be queried at most every 130 seconds.

 10. What would be the cost of sending 15,000 queries?

     - Approximately $5

## Price Feed Implementation

Associated AAVE price feeds are available via Cryptowatch. No other further feeds required.

## Ancillary Data Specifications

These price identifiers can optionally include ancillary data to specify a `twapLength`. When converted from bytes to UTF-8, the ancillary data should be a dictionary containing a twapLength key:value pair like so:

```
twapLength:7200
```

`twapLength` should be specified in seconds. If a `twapLength` key value pair is not present, then the spot price should be used.

When the ancillary data dictionary "twapLength:7200" is stored as bytes, the result would be: 0x747761704c656e6774683a37323030

### Technical Specifications

#### AAVE/USD:
  -  Price Identifier Name: `AAVEUSD`
  -  Base Currency: AAVE
  -  Quote Currency: USD
  -  Intended Collateral Currency: USDC
  -  Scaling Decimals: 18
  -  Rounding: Round to nearest 6 decimal places (seventh decimal place digit >= 5 rounds up and < 5 rounds down)
  -  Does the value of this collateral currency match the standalone value of the listed quote currency?: YES
  -  Is your collateral currency already approved to be used by UMA financial contracts?: YES

#### USD/AAVE:

  -  Price Identifier Name: `USDAAVE`
  -  Base Currency: USD
  -  Quote Currency: AAVE
  -  Intended Collateral Currency: AAVE
  -  Scaling Decimals: 18
  -  Rounding: Round to nearest 6 decimal places (seventh decimal place digit >= 5 rounds up and < 5 rounds down)
  -  Does the value of this collateral currency match the standalone value of the listed quote currency?: YES
  -  Is your collateral currency already approved to be used by UMA financial contracts?: In progress

### Implementation

Voters should query for the price of AAVE/USD at the price request timestamp on Coinbase Pro, Binance & OKEx. Recommended endpoints are provided in the markets and data sources section.

1.  When using the recommended endpoints, voters should use the open price of the 1 minute OHLC period that the timestamp falls in.
2.  The median of these results should be taken
3.  The median from step 2 should be rounded to six decimals to determine the AAVEUSD price.
4.  The value of USDAAVE will follow the exact same process but undergo one additional step: it will be the result of dividing 1/AAVEUSD rounded to nearest 18 decimal places (nineteenth decimal place digit >= 5 rounds up and < 5 rounds down).  
For both implementations, voters should determine whether the returned price differs from broad market consensus. This is meant to provide flexibility in any unforeseen circumstances as voters are responsible for defining broad market consensus.

If a `twapLength` is present in ancillary data, voters should calculate a TWAP with over that time period rather than calculating the spot price.

### Rationale

See "Rationale" section at the beginning of this UMIP as applied to `AAVEUSD` and `USDAAVE`.

### Rationale

## Security Considerations
From our understanding, there are no significant negative concerns stemming from introducing a UMA/USD pair. The price identifier bears the same implications as any other price identifier that synthetic assets are built on. This includes the risk of liquidation -- which would force UMA tokens changing owners via liquidation if the price of UMA/USD where to significantly *increase* causing positions to be under-collateralized.

One of the more pressing concerns has been using UMA as collateral -- a matter discussed in UMIP-#. In short, increasing the amount of UMA locked as collateral temporarily decreases the market supply -- thereby increasing the Cost of Corruption, increasing the security of the DVM.

-  Quote Currency: USD
-  Intended Collateral Currency: USDC
-  Scaling Decimals: 18
-  Rounding: Round to nearest 6 decimal places (seventh decimal place digit >= 5 rounds up and < 5 rounds down)
-  Does the value of this collateral currency match the standalone value of the listed quote currency?: YES
-  Is your collateral currency already approved to be used by UMA financial contracts?: YES

#### USD/UNI

-  Price Identifier Name: `USDUNI`
-  Base Currency: USD
-  Quote Currency: UNI
-  Intended Collateral Currency: UNI
-  Scaling Decimals: 18
-  Rounding: Round to nearest 6 decimal places (seventh decimal place digit >= 5 rounds up and < 5 rounds down)
-  Does the value of this collateral currency match the standalone value of the listed quote currency?: YES
-  Is your collateral currency already approved to be used by UMA financial contracts?: In progress

### Implementation

Voters should query for the price of UNI/USD at the price request timestamp on Coinbase Pro, Binance & OKEx. Recommended endpoints are provided in the markets and data sources section.

1.  When using the recommended endpoints, voters should use the open price of the 1 minute OHLC period that the timestamp falls in.
2.  The median of these results should be taken
3.  The median from step 2 should be rounded to six decimals to determine the UNIUSD price.
4.  The value of USDUNI will follow the exact same process but undergo one additional step: it will be the result of dividing 1/UNIUSD and rounding to the nearest 18 decimal places (nineteenth decimal place digit >= 5 rounds up and < 5 rounds down).  
For both implementations, voters should determine whether the returned price differs from broad market consensus. This is meant to provide flexibility in any unforeseen circumstances as voters are responsible for defining broad market consensus.

If a `twapLength` is present in ancillary data, voters should calculate a TWAP with over that time period rather than calculating the spot price.

### Rationale

See "Rationale" section at the beginning of this UMIP as applied to `UNIUSD` and `USDUNI`.

# Security Considerations
Adding these new identifiers by itself poses little security risk to the DVM or priceless financial contract users. However, anyone deploying a new priceless token contract referencing these identifiers should take care to parameterize the contract appropriately to avoid the loss of funds for synthetic token holders. Additionally, the contract deployer should ensure that there is a network of liquidators and disputers ready to perform the services necessary to keep the contract solvent.

$UMA-holders should evaluate the ongoing cost and benefit of supporting price requests for these identifiers and also contemplate de-registering these identifiers if security holes are identified. As noted above, $UMA-holders should also consider re-defining this identifier as liquidity in the underlying asset changes, or if added robustness is necessary to prevent market manipulation.
